Gitlab
======

This is based on official docker image but mostly the one by Sameer Naik.

Most notable modifications compared to the solutions mentioned above and differences in design:

+ Based on Debian Jessie.
+ Isolated build steps into build-only container which resulted in a much smaller runtime image.
+ Clearly separated initialisation and startup actions need to be taken. Startup should be fast.
+ Cleaner volumes, isolated `data` and `repositiories` containers - the latter should be shareable accross multiple instances load-balanced instances.
+ Better directory structure - all relevant configurations are externalised.

Some features are removed for sake of simplicity and easier configuration / dependency management:

+ Only PostgreSQL is supported as a DB backend - Postgres is the recommended DB anyway.
+ Removed HTTPS support; use a load balancer or front-end proxy with HTTPS support.

Start like

    docker run -it -v `pwd`:/tmp/out --name=gitlab-runtest\
     --link=gitlab-redis:redis\
     --link=gitlab-postgres:postgres\
     -e 
     zsoltm/gitlab-armhf:7.11.4-1

It expects a Redis and a PostgreSQL container being linked named as "gitlab-redis" and "gitlab-postgresql"
respectively.

# Requirements

A PostgreSQL DB container:

    docker run --name gitlab-postgres -e POSTGRES_USER=git -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=6nPDNTxp -d zsoltm/postgresql-armhf

A Redis DB container:

    docker run --name gitlab-redis
